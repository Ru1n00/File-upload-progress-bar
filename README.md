This repository features a file upload progress bar made using only Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap, combined with the power of Django on the backend. Users can see the progress of the upload in a cool and sleek bar as they wait for large files to upload. Easy to set up with minimal coding needed! Enjoy!
